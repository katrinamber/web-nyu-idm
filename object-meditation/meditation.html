  <h1>ASMR</h1>

    <div class="my-fun-class">
      <p> Listening to ASMR is a sort of meditation that I do if I can't fall asleep. It's really calming listening to someone's voice and affirming you. </p>
    </div>

    <h1>Deep Breaths</h1>

      <div class="my-fun-class">
        <p> I like to take 10 deep breaths to help take things off my mind. It's easier to sleep without needing to think about something.
        My mantra or pattern that I follow is I inhale for 3 seconds, hold 3 seconds and out 3 seconds. </p>
